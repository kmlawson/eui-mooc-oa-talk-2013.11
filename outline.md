# Open Access and MOOCs

*2013.11.19 Max Weber Programme 8th Academic Careers Observatory Conference*  
*European University Institute - Florence, Italy*

This brief 15 minute presentation provides an overview of the main categories of critique that have emerged against two movements in higher education and research which both began as ways to strengthen academic communities and the student learning experience: open access and the general category of online education known as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). They have both increasingly been seen as either a universal solution or an ominous threat. As a specific and pragmatic way forward, I argue for the intersection of the two. I propose that faculty and students move to support modularity, decentralisation, and "libre" access to the "full stack," that is, a genuine openness at every layer of the MOOC platform and their courses both as a way, perhaps ironically, to retain greater control over the process, and to realise some of the initial goals that have long motivated educators to innovate in the field of open online education.
